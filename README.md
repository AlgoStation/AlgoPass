# AlgoPass Password Manager
AlgoPass is an open source chrome extension that leverages the [Algorand](https://algorand.foundation/) blockchain to securely store your encrypted passwords in the transaction note field.

## Why AlgoPass?
Password managers today require you to trust the provider with your data as well as trusting the security of their servers. Having sensitive information in the hands of others is incredibly risky and centralised systems frequently suffer from security breaches that can be out of your control and you might never even know it happened. Storing data on the Algorand blockchain, however, solves these issues: its security and decentralized nature mean that you don't have to trust anyone but yourself when it comes to protecting your passwords. AlgoPass is the worlds first blockchain based password manager we're excited to hear your feedback!

## Installation
Currently, the extension is still in early development stages so is not yet publicly available on the Chrome Web Store, but if you want to try it out you can:
1) Clone the repo
2) Open Chrome
3) At the top right, click ⋮ > More tools > Extensions
3) Activate *Developer mode* at the top right of the page
4) Drag the AlgoPass folder into your extensions menu

## Setup
**Node** - To be able to use AlgoPass you can either have an Algorand Node installed locally on your machine or you can use the PureStake API. 

Local Installation:
- Follow the steps outlined on [Algorand's developer website](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/) (for Mac, Debian, RPM, and other Linux distros) 

Using the Purestake API:  
1) Head over to the [Purestake's Developer Portal](https://developer.purestake.io/) and make an account
2) Once you login you will find the server and your API key (**KEEP IT A SECRET!**)


**Account** - when you install the extension, you can either choose to import a mnemonic passphrase from another AlgoPass installation or create a new one (recommended).
