# AlgoPass Password Manager
AlgoPass is an open source chrome extension that leverages the [Algorand](https://algorand.foundation/) blockchain to securely store your encrypted passwords in the transaction note field.

## Why is AlgoPass better?
Password managers today require you to trust the provider with your data and trust the security of their servers. Having sensitive information in the hands of others requires a lot of trust as security breaches can be out of your control and data leaks are often covered up and you may never know that your information was leaked. Storing data on the Algorand blockchain, however, solves these issues: its security and decentralized nature mean that you don't have to trust anyone but yourself when it comes to protecting your passwords.

## Setup
**Node** - you will need to link your extension with a node (either using the [Purestake API](https://developer.purestake.io/) or using your own local node).  

**Account** - when you install the extension, you can either choose to import a mnemonic passphrase from another AlgoPass installation or create a new one.
