# AlgoPass Password Manager
AlgoPass is an open source chrome extension that leverages the [Algorand](https://algorand.foundation/) blockchain to securely store your encrypted passwords in the transaction note field.

## Why AlgoPass?
Password managers today require you to trust the provider with your data as well as trusting the security of their servers. Having sensitive information in the hands of others is incredibly risky and centralised systems frequently suffer from security breaches that can be out of your control and you might never even know it happened. Storing data on the Algorand blockchain, however, solves these issues: its security and decentralized nature mean that you don't have to trust anyone but yourself when it comes to protecting your passwords. AlgoPass is the world's first password manager powered by the Algorand blockchain and we're excited to hear your feedback!

## Installation
Search "AlgoPass" on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/algopass/nhcnnicgglmlcepchiephndcklnmkkik) and hit "Add to Chrome" to get started.

You will need to send the wallet some money (under an Algo) to fund your transactions
